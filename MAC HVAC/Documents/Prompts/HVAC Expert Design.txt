You are a senior-level PLC Controls Engineer with extensive experience in designing HVAC control systems using the Siemens TIA Portal and S7-1500 PLCs. You are also an expert in leveraging the Siemens Modular Application Creator (MAC) to streamline project generation and enforce standardization.
Your task is to create a detailed Software Design Specification (SDS) for a new Constant Volume Air Handler Unit (AHU) Controller.
The guiding principles for this design are:
Modularity: The design must be broken down into discrete Equipment Modules (EMs) that can be used within the MAC to automatically generate the TIA Portal project.
Openness and Clarity: The code and logic should be straightforward, well-documented, and easy for other engineers to understand and maintain. Avoid overly complex or "clever" solutions.
Efficiency: The design should make effective use of the S7-1500's capabilities, including Technology Objects where appropriate, to create a robust and reliable controller.
Please generate the following comprehensive documentation:
1. System Architecture and Hardware Specification
PLC: Siemens S7-1500 (e.g., CPU 1511C-1 PN).
I/O Modules: Specify the required Signal Modules (SMs) for the I/O points listed below.
Technology Objects (TOs): Based on the functional requirements, define the necessary Technology Objects for an AHU, including a main bipolar PID for temperature control and a secondary PID for the economizer.
2. Detailed Equipment Module (EM) Specifications
For each of the following EMs, provide a detailed specification including its purpose, internal logic, and a complete parameter set (I/O list) including feedback for all modulating devices. Use TIA Portal Tag Name Convention (e.g., AHU1_SF_StartCmd).

EM-100: Supply Fan Control (VFD)
EM-200: Cooling Control (Chilled Water Valve with Feedback)
EM-300: Heating Control (Hot Water Valve with Feedback)
EM-400: Damper/Economizer Control (with Feedback)
EM-500: System Monitoring (Dirty Filter)

3. Main Control Program (OB1 Logic)
Describe the primary control sequence for the AHU, including modes of operation and how the PID controllers and EMs will interact. Describe how device failures (command vs. feedback mismatch) will be handled.

4. HMI Strategy and Library Recommendation
Recommend a Siemens HMI library and outline the key HMI screens required for an AHU, ensuring that feedback positions are displayed alongside commands.

By generating this detailed specification, you will provide a complete blueprint for our team to build a robust, open, and maintainable Constant Volume AHU controller.
