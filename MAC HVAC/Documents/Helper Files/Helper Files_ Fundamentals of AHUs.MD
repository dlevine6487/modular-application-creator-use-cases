Airside Unit Control Fundamentals: A Synopsis

This guide summarizes the core principles of controlling airside HVAC systems, from simple single-zone units to more complex multi-zone air handlers. The primary goal of any airside system is to effectively manage airflow, as this is the medium for controlling a building's temperature, humidity, and air quality.[1][2]

Core Concepts

Pressurization: Buildings are typically kept at a positive pressure, meaning more air is supplied than exhausted. This prevents untreated outside air from infiltrating the building. Specific zones, like isolation rooms, may be kept at a negative pressure to contain the air within them.[2]

Airflow: The main variable in airside control is airflow. Without proper airflow, controlling temperature or humidity is impossible. Fans are used to move air through ductwork to the designated spaces.[1][2]

Single-Zone Units

These units typically serve a single, specific space.

Fan Coils

Operation: Fan coils are often used for individual zone control in areas like data closets. They typically use internal building air (plenum air) and condition it using hot or chilled water (hydronic) coils.[2]

Control: A fan coil controls the space temperature by running a fan and modulating heating or cooling valves. They are equipped with a condensate pan and an alarm to shut the unit off if the pan overflows.[2]

Rooftop Units (RTUs)

Operation: RTUs are self-contained "packaged" units located on the roof. They commonly use direct expansion (DX) for cooling and either natural gas or electricity for heating.[2]

Control & Economizer Mode: Like fan coils, RTUs control the temperature of a single zone. A key feature is the economizer mode, which uses cool outside air ("free cooling") instead of mechanical cooling when conditions are favorable. This is controlled by comparing either the temperature (dry bulb) or total heat content including humidity (enthalpy) of the outside air versus the return air.[2]

Multi-Zone Air Handling Units (AHUs)

AHUs are larger systems designed to serve multiple zones simultaneously. They achieve this by either varying the air temperature while keeping the volume constant, or by varying the air volume while keeping the temperature constant.[1]

Constant Air Volume (CAV or CV)

Operation: A CAV unit supplies a constant volume of air to the spaces it serves.[1]

Control: Temperature control is achieved by modulating the discharge air temperature. The system adjusts its heating and cooling output based on the average temperature of the zones it serves. Safety controls are critical and include high/low static pressure switches for the fan, low-temperature cutouts to prevent coil freezing, and smoke detectors.[1]

Variable Air Volume (VAV)

Operation: VAV systems are more advanced and energy-efficient. They supply a constant temperature of air (typically 55Â°F) and vary the volume of air delivered to each zone via VAV boxes.[1]

Control: The primary control mechanism is a Variable Frequency Drive (VFD) on the supply fan. The VFD adjusts the fan's speed to maintain a constant static pressure in the main ductwork. As individual VAV boxes open or close their dampers based on zone demand, the fan speed adjusts accordingly.[1]

Advanced Control Strategies

Demand Ventilation (CO2 Control): To ensure fresh air requirements are met (per ASHRAE 62.1), systems can use CO2 sensors. If CO2 levels in the return air rise, indicating higher occupancy, the outdoor air damper opens to bring in more fresh air.[1]

Enthalpy Control: When deciding whether to use outdoor air for free cooling, simply comparing temperatures can be misleading in humid climates. Enthalpy control measures both temperature and humidity to determine if the outdoor air has less total energy (heat content) than the return air, providing a more efficient control strategy.[2]

Discharge Air Pressure Reset: In VAV systems, the discharge air pressure setpoint can be reset (lowered) to save energy. This is often done using a "trim and response" sequence, which slowly adjusts the setpoint based on how many VAV boxes are calling for more air.
