### **1.0 Purpose**
The purpose of this Installation Qualification (IQ) protocol is to verify and document that the HVAC system, its components, and the associated Building Automation System (BAS) have been installed correctly, in accordance with the approved design documents, P&IDs, and manufacturer's recommendations.

### **2.0 Scope**
This IQ protocol covers the physical installation of all components related to the HVAC system for the Grade A, B, and C areas, including:
*   Air Handling Units (AHUs)
*   Ductwork, piping, and insulation
*   Terminal HEPA filters
*   Instrumentation and sensors (Temperature, RH, Pressure)
*   BAS hardware (Siemens S7-PLC panels, I/O modules, wiring)
